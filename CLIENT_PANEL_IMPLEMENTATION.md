## Technical Implementation

### Design Patterns
- All components use `ClientDashboardLayout` for consistent structure
- Breadcrumb navigation for clear user location awareness
- Card-based UI following shadcn/ui patterns
- Responsive grid layouts for different screen sizes
- Consistent color coding and badge usage across components

### Data Structure
- Mock data follows real-world project structures
- Type-safe interfaces for all data models
- Consistent naming conventions across components
- Reusable data patterns (projects, files, contacts, events)

### User Experience
- Loading states handled consistently
- Empty states with helpful messages
- Action buttons with clear icons and labels
- Tooltips and descriptions for complex features
- Search and filter capabilities where appropriate

### Navigation
- All routes added to Router.tsx
- Nested routes for logical grouping
- Direct access from sidebar menu items
- Consistent URL structure (`/client/[section]/[subsection]`)

## Route Structure

```
/client
  ├── /dashboard (Main dashboard overview)
  │   └── /activity (Recent activity timeline)
  ├── /projects (Projects overview)
  │   ├── /active (Active projects)
  │   ├── /completed (Completed projects)
  │   └── /timeline (Project timeline)
  ├── /messages (Project messages)
  │   └── /contacts (Team contacts)
  ├── /files (Project files)
  │   ├── /downloads (Download history)
  │   └── /shared (Shared documents)
  ├── /calendar (Schedule overview)
  │   ├── /milestones (Project milestones)
  │   └── /meetings (Meetings)
  ├── /notifications (Notification center)
  ├── /settings (Account settings)
  └── /support (Help & support)
```

## Consistency Across Dashboards

### Shared Components
- All dashboards use similar layout patterns
- Common UI components (Card, Badge, Button, etc.)
- Consistent data models for shared entities (projects, users, files)

### Role-Based Features
- Client features focused on viewing and communication
- Admin features include management and analytics
- Freelancer features include time tracking and earnings
- Common features: messages, files, calendar, settings, notifications

### Data Synchronization
- All dashboards work with the same project data structures
- File management consistent across roles
- Messaging interface similar for all users
- Calendar events shared across relevant users
