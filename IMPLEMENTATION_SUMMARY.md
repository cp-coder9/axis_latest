   - Accessible via `/freelancer/timer` route

3. **FreelancerEarningsPage** (`src/pages/FreelancerEarningsPage.tsx`)
   - Complete earnings dashboard
   - Wraps FreelancerEarningsDashboard component
   - Accessible via `/freelancer/earnings` route

4. **FreelancerApplicationsPage** (`src/pages/FreelancerApplicationsPage.tsx`)
   - Project applications management
   - Uses FreelancerProjectApplicationWidget
   - Accessible via `/freelancer/applications` route

### 4. Router Updates (`src/Router.tsx`)

#### Changes:
- Imported all new page components (4 new freelancer pages)
- Replaced placeholder pages with actual implementations for freelancer routes:
  - `/freelancer/projects` - FreelancerProjectsPage (NEW)
  - `/freelancer/timer` - FreelancerTimerPage (NEW)
  - `/freelancer/earnings` - FreelancerEarningsPage (NEW)
  - `/freelancer/applications` - FreelancerApplicationsPage (NEW)
- Updated client routes to use existing pages (were using PlaceholderPage before):
  - `/client/projects` - ClientProjectsPage (existed, now properly routed)
  - `/client/files` - ClientFilesPage (existed, now properly routed)
  - `/client/messages` - ClientMessagesPage (existed, now properly routed)

**Total PlaceholderPage instances removed:** 7 (4 freelancer + 3 client)

### 5. Admin Dashboard

The Admin Dashboard (`src/pages/AdminDashboardPage.tsx`) was already complete with:
- Overview tab with quick stats
- User Management tab with RoleManagementPanel
- Activity Monitor tab with UserActivityMonitor
- Analytics tab with SystemAnalytics

No changes were needed for the Admin Dashboard.

## Reusable Components Utilized

### Freelancer Components:
- `ProjectTable` - Displays projects with timer controls
- `FreelancerTimerWidget` - Active timer with start/pause/stop
- `FreelancerEarningsDashboard` - Complete earnings analytics
- `FreelancerProjectApplicationWidget` - Project applications management

### Client Components:
- `ClientProjectOverview` - Project list with status tracking
- `ClientMessagingInterface` - Real-time messaging system
- `ClientFileAccessSystem` - Secure file management

### Shared Components:
- `ModernDashboardCard` - Animated stat cards with trends
- `AnimatedStatCard` - Performance metric displays
- Various UI components from shadcn/ui

## Key Features

### Data Integration:
- All components use `useAppContext()` to access application state
- Projects are filtered based on user role and assignments from context
- Recent time logs in FreelancerDashboard and FreelancerTimerPage use mock/hardcoded data for demonstration
- Weekly stats (hours, earnings) use mock data pending backend time tracking API
- Client projects, messages, and files use data from their respective existing components
- Real data integration points: project assignments, user info, role data from AppContext

### User Experience:
- Consistent design across all dashboards
- Smooth transitions between tabs
- Loading states with skeleton screens
- Empty states with helpful messages
- Responsive layouts for mobile and desktop

### Navigation:
- Dashboard tabs for quick access to different sections
- Standalone pages accessible via sidebar navigation
- Proper role-based access control via `AuthGuard`
- Breadcrumb navigation support

## Testing Considerations

### Manual Testing Checklist:
- [ ] Login as Freelancer and verify all dashboard tabs work
- [ ] Navigate to standalone freelancer pages via sidebar
- [ ] Login as Client and verify all dashboard tabs work
- [ ] Navigate to client pages via sidebar  
- [ ] Login as Admin and verify dashboard is functional
- [ ] Test responsive design on mobile devices
- [ ] Verify proper loading states
- [ ] Check empty states when no data available
- [ ] Test timer functionality
- [ ] Verify project table filtering works correctly

### Known Limitations:
- **Recent time logs**: Hardcoded mock data in FreelancerDashboard and FreelancerTimerPage (lines showing "Office Redesign Project" etc.)
- **Weekly stats**: Mock data for hours/earnings calculations - needs backend time tracking API
- **Timer state**: Timer persistence requires backend integration for cross-device sync
- **File operations**: ClientFileAccessSystem download/preview handlers need actual Cloudinary/storage backend
- **Messaging**: ClientMessagingInterface uses component's internal mock data, needs real-time backend
- **Real data already working**: Project assignments, user roles, project table data from AppContext
